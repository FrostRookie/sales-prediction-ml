# 📈 Sales Prediction using Advertising Data

## 📌 Overview
This project develops a **Machine Learning model** to predict product sales based on advertising expenditure across **TV**, **Radio**, and **Newspaper** channels.  
The model uses **Linear Regression** and is implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook**, making it easy to understand and reproduce.

The dataset used is the **Advertising dataset**, which contains historical ad spend and corresponding sales figures.
